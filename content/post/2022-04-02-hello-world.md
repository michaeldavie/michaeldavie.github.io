## Setting up a blog

A couple hours ago I thought that I should set up a blog, and it's already up and running. Fortunately I already had some of the pieces in place (like a Github account and the domain name), but the whole thing was surprisingly simple. Here are the tools that helped:

- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) - Static website generator
- [Clean White Theme for Hugo](https://github.com/zhaohuabing/hugo-theme-cleanwhite) - Simple blog theme
- [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) - Free hosting from Github
- [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) - Automated workflows triggered on code changes
- [Github Actions for Hugo](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-hugo) - Workflow to execute Hugo's build and update the site
- [Cloudflare DNS](https://www.cloudflare.com/dns/) - DNS resolution for my domain
- [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) - Free TLS certificate, managed by Github
